                    <p>
                        Nilbert is, in fact, not called Nilbert in the real world. The image of Nilbert originated from a tweet posted by @ollyonecat, being Nilberts real name (olly). The caption "ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 못생겼어" roughly transalates to "hahahahahahaha, it's ugly", which is why the image of the cat may also be "ugly cat" or something similar.

                    <h4>Rigby</h4>
                    <p>
                        Rigby is a meme-famous cat known for a GIF/image where she sticks her tongue out while staring at the camera. 

She is associated with a neurological condition called “fainting goat syndrome” (myotonia congenita), which causes her muscles to stiffen or temporarily lock up under excitement or stress. 

Her social media presence is under @iamrigbycat (Instagram, TikTok), where her quirky expressions and behaviors have gained wide attention.

                    <h4>Maxwell, real name Jess (The original oiia)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Maxwell the Cat (real name Jess) was a black-and-white tuxedo cat who became famous online for her calm, spinning 3D model meme. Originally based on a real photo of Jess lying on a “Please Do Not Bend” envelope, she was turned into the “Maxwell the Carryable Cat” model used in Garry’s Mod and other games. Her spinning videos, especially the oiia oiia meme, went viral for their catchy rhythm and silly charm. Though Jess has since passed away, Maxwell lives on as one of the internet’s most iconic and beloved meme cats.

                    <h4>Ethel the cat</h4>
                    <p>
                    Ethel the Cat is a 13-year-old female cat from The Cat Welfare Association. Born blind and with dwarfism, she needed help with cleaning and loved spinning in circles at mealtime. No one wanted to adopt her until Donna came along, saying, “It was love at first sight.” Ethel lived a happy life as a blind house cat until her dad posted her photo on Facebook — it went viral, inspiring the famous oiia oiia meme featuring Ethel spinning (fitting, since she loves to spin). That’s the silly cat Ethel!

                    <h4>Tole tole</h4>
                    <p>
                    Tole Tole/Mei Mei is a cat whose owner goes by the username of tangtang_656. In December 2023, the user had posted a video with the iconic cat being held, with the background sound as "Moka Chan Oshiete Kureta Irona Mita". During that time, the user had grown popularity. In January 2024, the user completely skyrocketed, leading to Mei Mei being known as the "Tole Tole" cat, or "Vro", turning it into a meme. Now there are videos from all across the internet with Mei Mei. One viral meme of her is of Mei Mei running away, that later got some background music and effects and that went viral, along with the original video that started it all.
